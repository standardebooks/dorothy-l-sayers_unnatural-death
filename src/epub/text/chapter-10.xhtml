			<p>“Oh, Miss Evelyn, my dear, oh, poor dear!” The tall girl in black started, and looked round.</p>
			<p>“Why, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gulliver⁠—how very, very kind of you to come and meet me!”</p>
			<p>“And glad I am to have the chance, my dear, all owing to these kind gentlemen,” cried the landlady, flinging her arms round the girl and clinging to her to the great annoyance of the other passengers pouring off the gangway. The elder of the two gentlemen referred to gently put his hand on her arm, and drew them out of the stream of traffic.</p>
			<p>“Poor lamb!” mourned <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gulliver, “coming all this way by your lonesome, and poor dear Miss Bertha in her grave and such terrible things said, and her such a good girl always.”</p>
			<p>“It’s poor mother I’m thinking about,” said the girl. “I couldn’t rest. I said to my husband, ‘I must go,’ I said, and he said, ‘My honey, if I could come with you I would, but I can’t leave the farm, but if you feel you ought to go, you shall,’ he said.”</p>
			<p>“Dear <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cropper⁠—he was always that good and kind,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gulliver, “but here I am, forgittin’ all about the good gentlemen as brought me all this way to see you. This is Lord Peter Wimsey, and this is <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, as put in that unfortnit advertisement, as I truly believes was the beginnin’ of it all. ’Ow I wish I’d never showed it to your poor sister, not but wot I believe the gentleman acted with the best intentions, ’avin’ now seen ’im, which at first I thought ’e was a wrong ’un.”</p>
			<p>“Pleased to meet you,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, turning with the ready address derived from service in a big restaurant. “Just before I sailed I got a letter from poor Bertha enclosing your ad. I couldn’t make anything of it, but I’d be glad to know anything which can clear up this shocking business. What have they said it is⁠—murder?”</p>
			<p>“There was a verdict of natural death at the inquiry,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, “but we feel that the case presents some inconsistencies, and shall be exceedingly grateful for your cooperation in looking into the matter, and also in connection with another matter which may or may not have some bearing upon it.”</p>
			<p>“Righto,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper. “I’m sure you’re proper gentlemen, if <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gulliver answers for you, for I’ve never known her mistaken in a person yet, have I, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> G? I’ll tell you anything I know, which isn’t much, for it’s all a horrible mystery to me. Only I don’t want you to delay me, for I’ve got to go straight on down to Mother. She’ll be in a dreadful way, so fond as she was of Bertha, and she’s all alone except for the young girl that looks after her, and that’s not much comfort when you’ve lost your daughter so sudden.”</p>
			<p>“We shall not detain you a moment, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles. “We propose, if you will allow us, to accompany you to London, and to ask you a few questions on the way, and then⁠—again with your permission⁠—we should like to see you safely home to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gotobed’s house, wherever that may be.”</p>
			<p>“Christchurch, near Bournemouth,” said Lord Peter. “I’ll run you down straight away, if you like. It will save time.”</p>
			<p>“I say, you know all about it, don’t you?” exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper with some admiration. “Well, hadn’t we better get a move on, or we’ll miss this train?”</p>
			<p>“Quite right,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles. “Allow me to offer you my arm.”</p>
			<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper approving of this arrangement, the party made its way to the station, after the usual disembarkation formalities. As they passed the barrier on to the platform <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper gave a little exclamation and leaned forward as though something had caught her eye.</p>
			<p>“What is it, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper?” said Lord Peter’s voice in her ear. “Did you think you recognised somebody?”</p>
			<p>“You’re a noticing one, aren’t you?” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper. “Make a good waiter⁠—you would⁠—not meaning any offence, sir, that’s a real compliment from one who knows. Yes, I did think I saw someone, but it couldn’t be, because the minute she caught my eye she went away.”</p>
			<p>“Who did you think it was?”</p>
			<p>“Why, I thought it looked like Miss Whittaker, as Bertha and me used to work for.”</p>
			<p>“Where was she?”</p>
			<p>“Just down by that pillar there, a tall dark lady in a crimson hat and grey fur. But she’s gone now.”</p>
			<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
			<p>Lord Peter unhitched <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gulliver from his arm, hitched her smartly on to the unoccupied arm of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, and plunged into the crowd. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, quite unperturbed by this eccentric behaviour, shepherded the two women into an empty first-class carriage which, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper noted, bore a large label, “Reserved for Lord Peter Wimsey and party.” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper made some protesting observation about her ticket, but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles merely replied that everything was provided for, and that privacy could be more conveniently secured in this way.</p>
			<p>“Your friend’s going to be left behind,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper as the train moved out.</p>
			<p>“That would be very unlike him,” replied <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, calmly unfolding a couple of rugs and exchanging his old-fashioned top-hat for a curious kind of travelling cap with flaps to it. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, in the midst of her anxiety, could not help wondering where in the world he had contrived to purchase this Victorian relic. As a matter of fact, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles’ caps were specially made to his own design by an exceedingly expensive West End hatter, who held <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles in deep respect as a real gentleman of the old school.</p>
			<p>Nothing, however, was seen of Lord Peter for something like a quarter of an hour, when he suddenly put his head in with an amiable smile and said:</p>
			<p>“One red-haired woman in a crimson hat; three dark women in black hats; several nondescript women in those pull-on sort of dust-coloured hats; old women with grey hair, various; sixteen flappers without hats⁠—hats on rack, I mean, but none of ’em crimson; two obvious brides in blue hats; innumerable fair women in hats of all colours; one ash-blonde dressed as a nurse, none of ’em our friend as far as I know. Thought I’d best just toddle along the train to make sure. There’s just one dark sort of female whose hat I can’t see because it’s tucked down beside her. Wonder if <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper would mind doin’ a little stagger down the corridor to take a squint at her.”</p>
			<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, with some surprise, consented to do so.</p>
			<p>“Right you are. ’Splain later. About four carriages along. Now, look here, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, if it <em>should</em> be anybody you know, I’d rather on the whole she didn’t spot you watching her. I want you to walk along behind me, just glancin’ into the compartments but keepin’ your collar turned up. When we come to the party I have in mind, I’ll make a screen for you, what?”</p>
			<p>These manoeuvres were successfully accomplished, Lord Peter lighting a cigarette opposite the suspected compartment, while <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper viewed the hatless lady under cover of his raised elbows. But the result was disappointing. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper had never seen the lady before, and a further promenade from end to end of the train produced no better results.</p>
			<p>“We must leave it to Bunter, then,” said his lordship, cheerfully, as they returned to their seats. “I put him on the trail as soon as you gave me the good word. Now, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, we really get down to business. First of all, we should be glad of any suggestions you may have to make about your sister’s death. We don’t want to distress you, but we have got an idea that there might, just possibly, be something behind it.”</p>
			<p>“There’s just one thing, sir⁠—your lordship, I suppose I should say. Bertha was a real good girl⁠—I can answer for that absolutely. There wouldn’t have been any carryings-on with her young man⁠—nothing of that. I know people have been saying all sorts of things, and perhaps, with lots of girls as they are, it isn’t to be wondered at. But, believe me, Bertha wouldn’t go for to do anything that wasn’t right. Perhaps you’d like to see this last letter she wrote me. I’m sure nothing could be nicer and properer from a girl just looking forward to a happy marriage. Now, a girl as wrote like that wouldn’t be going larking about, sir, would she? I couldn’t rest, thinking they was saying that about her.”</p>
			<p>Lord Peter took the letter, glanced through it, and handed it reverently to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles.</p>
			<p>“We’re not thinking that at all, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, though of course we’re very glad to have your point of view, don’t you see. Now, do you think it possible your sister might have been⁠—what shall I say?⁠—got hold of by some woman with a plausible story and all that, and⁠—well⁠—pushed into some position which shocked her very much? Was she cautious and up to the tricks of London people and all that?”</p>
			<p>And he outlined Parker’s theory of the engaging <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Forrest and the supposed dinner in the flat.</p>
			<p>“Well, my lord, I wouldn’t say Bertha was a very quick girl⁠—not as quick as me, you know. She’d always be ready to believe what she was told and give people credit for the best. Took more after her father, like. I’m mother’s girl, they always said, and I don’t trust anybody further than I can see them. But I’d warned her very careful against taking up with women as talks to a girl in the street, and she did ought to have been on her guard.”</p>
			<p>“Of course,” said Peter, “it may have been somebody she’d got to know quite well⁠—say, at the restaurant, and she thought she was a nice lady and there’d be no harm in going to see her. Or the lady might have suggested taking her into good service. One never knows.”</p>
			<p>“I think she’d have mentioned it in her letters if she’d talked to the lady much, my lord. It’s wonderful what a lot of things she’d find to tell me about the customers. And I don’t think she’d be for going into service again. We got real fed up with service, down in Leahampton.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, yes. Now that brings us to quite a different point⁠—the thing we wanted to ask you or your sister about before this sad accident took place. You were in service with this Miss Whittaker whom you mentioned just now. I wonder if you’d mind telling us just exactly why you left. It was a good place, I suppose?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, my lord, quite a good place as places go, though of course a girl doesn’t get her freedom the way she does in a restaurant. And naturally there was a good deal of waiting on the old lady. Not as we minded that, for she was a very kind, good lady, and generous too.”</p>
			<p>“But when she became so ill, I suppose Miss Whittaker managed everything, what?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, my lord; but it wasn’t a hard place⁠—lots of the girls envied us. Only Miss Whittaker was very particular.”</p>
			<p>“Especially about the china, what?”</p>
			<p>“Ah, they told you about that, then?”</p>
			<p>“I told ’em, dearie,” put in <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gulliver, “I told ’em all about how you come to leave your place and go to London.”</p>
			<p>“And it struck us,” put in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, “that it was, shall we say, somewhat rash of Miss Whittaker to dismiss so competent and, if I may put it so, so well-spoken and personable a pair of maids on so trivial a pretext.”</p>
			<p>“You’re right there, sir. Bertha⁠—I told you she was the trusting one⁠—she was quite ready to believe as she done wrong, and thought how good it was of Miss Whittaker to forgive her breaking the china, and take so much interest in sending us to London, but I always thought there was something more than met the eye. Didn’t I, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Gulliver?”</p>
			<p>“That you did, dear; something more than meets the eye, that’s what you says to me, and what I agrees with.”</p>
			<p>“And did you, in your own mind,” pursued <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, “connect this sudden dismissal with anything which had taken place?”</p>
			<p>“Well, I did then,” replied <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, with some spirit. “I said to Bertha⁠—but she would hear nothing of it, taking after her father as I tell you⁠—I said, ‘Mark my words,’ I said, ‘Miss Whittaker don’t care to have us in the house after the row she had with the old lady.’ ”</p>
			<p>“And what row was that?” inquired <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles.</p>
			<p>“Well, I don’t know as I ought rightly to tell you about it, seeing it’s all over now and we promised to say nothing about it.”</p>
			<p>“That, of course,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, checking Lord Peter, who was about to burst in impetuously, “depends upon your own conscience. But, if it will be of any help to you in making up your mind, I think I may say, in the strictest confidence, that this information may be of the utmost importance to us⁠—in a roundabout way which I won’t trouble you with⁠—in investigating a very singular set of circumstances which have been brought to our notice. And it is just barely possible⁠—again in a very roundabout way⁠—that it may assist us in throwing some light on the melancholy tragedy of your sister’s decease. Further than that I cannot go at the moment.”</p>
			<p>“Well, now,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, “if that’s so⁠—though, mind you, I don’t see what connection there could be⁠—but if you think that’s so, I reckon I’d better come across with it, as my husband would say. After all, I only promised I wouldn’t mention about it to the people in Leahampton, as might have made mischief out of it⁠—and a gossipy lot they is, and no mistake.”</p>
			<p>“We’ve nothing to do with the Leahampton crowd,” said his lordship, “and it won’t be passed along unless it turns out to be necessary.”</p>
			<p>“Righto. Well, I’ll tell you. One morning early in September Miss Whittaker comes along to Bertha and I, and says, I want you girls to be just handy on the landing outside Miss Dawson’s bedroom,’ she says, ‘because I may want you to come in and witness her signature to a document. We shall want two witnesses,’ she says, ‘and you’ll have to see her sign; but I don’t want to flurry her with a lot of people in the room, so when I give you the tip, I want you to come just inside the door without making a noise, so that you can see her write her name, and then I’ll bring it straight across to you and you can write your names where I show you. It’s quite easy,’ she says, ‘nothing to do but just put your names opposite where you see the word Witnesses.’</p>
			<p>“Bertha was always a bit the timid sort⁠—afraid of documents and that sort of thing, and she tried to get out of it. ‘Couldn’t Nurse sign instead of me?’ she says. That was Nurse Philliter, you know, the red-haired one as was the doctor’s fiancée. She was a very nice woman, and we liked her quite a lot. ‘Nurse has gone out for her walk,’ says Miss Whittaker, rather sharp, ‘I want you and Evelyn to do it,’ meaning me, of course. Well, we said we didn’t mind, and Miss Whittaker goes upstairs to Miss Dawson with a whole heap of papers, and Bertha and I followed and waited on the landing, like she said.”</p>
			<p>“One moment,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, “did Miss Dawson often have documents to sign?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir, I believe so, quite frequently, but they was usually witnessed by Miss Whittaker or the nurse. There was some leases and things of that sort, or so I heard. Miss Dawson had a little house-property. And then there’d be the cheques for the housekeeping, and some papers as used to come from the Bank and be put away in the safe.”</p>
			<p>“Share coupons and so on, I suppose,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles.</p>
			<p>“Very likely, sir, I don’t know much about those business matters. I did have to witness a signature once, I remember, a long time back, but that was different. The paper was brought down to me with the signature ready wrote. There wasn’t any of this to-do about it.”</p>
			<p>“The old lady was capable of dealing with her own affairs, I understand?”</p>
			<p>“Up till then, sir. Afterwards, as I understood, she made it all over to Miss Whittaker⁠—that was just before she got feeble-like, and was kept under drugs. Miss Whittaker signed the cheques then.”</p>
			<p>“The power of attorney,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, with a nod. “Well now, did you sign this mysterious paper?”</p>
			<p>“No, sir, I’ll tell you how that was. When me and Bertha had been waiting a little time, Miss Whittaker comes to the door and makes us a sign to come in quiet. So we comes and stands just inside the door. There was a screen by the head of the bed, so we couldn’t see Miss Dawson nor she us, but we could see her reflection quite well in a big looking-glass she had on the left side of the bed.”</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles exchanged a significant glance with Lord Peter.</p>
			<p>“Now be sure you tell us every detail,” said Wimsey, “no matter how small and silly it may sound. I believe this is goin’ to be very excitin’.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, my lord. Well, there wasn’t much else, except that just inside the door, on the left-hand side as you went in, there was a little table, where Nurse mostly used to set down trays and things that had to go down, and it was cleared, and a piece of blotting-paper on it and an inkstand and pen, all ready for us to sign with.”</p>
			<p>“Could Miss Dawson see that?” asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles.</p>
			<p>“No, sir, because of the screen.”</p>
			<p>“But it was inside the room.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
			<p>“We want to be quite clear about this. Do you think you could draw⁠—quite roughly⁠—a little plan of the room, showing where the bed was and the screen and the mirror, and so on?”</p>
			<p>“I’m not much of a hand at drawing,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper dubiously, “but I’ll try.”</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles produced a notebook and fountain pen, and after a few false starts, the following rough sketch was produced.</p>
			<figure id="illustration-1">
				<img alt="A sketch of the layout of Agatha Dawson’s bedroom showing the position of a mirror through which the maids could see her sign documents." src="../images/illustration-1.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration"/>
			</figure>
			<p>“Thank you, that is very clear indeed. You notice, Lord Peter, the careful arrangements to have the document signed in presence of the witnesses, and witnessed by them in the presence of Miss Dawson and of each other. I needn’t tell you for what kind of document that arrangement is indispensable.”</p>
			<p>“Was that it, sir? We couldn’t understand why it was all arranged like that.”</p>
			<p>“It might have happened,” explained <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, “that in case of some dispute about this document, you and your sister would have had to come into court and give evidence about it. And if so, you would have been asked whether you actually saw Miss Dawson write her signature, and whether you and your sister and Miss Dawson were all in the same room together when you signed your names as witnesses. And if that had happened, you could have said yes, couldn’t you, and sworn to it?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>
			<p>“And yet, actually, Miss Dawson would have known nothing about your being there.”</p>
			<p>“No, sir.”</p>
			<p>“That was it, you see.”</p>
			<p>“I see now, sir, but at the time Bertha and me couldn’t make nothing of it.”</p>
			<p>“But the document, you say, was never signed.”</p>
			<p>“No, sir. At any rate, we never witnessed anything. We saw Miss Dawson write her name⁠—at least, I suppose it was her name⁠—to one or two papers, and then Miss Whittaker puts another lot in front of her and says, ‘Here’s another little lot, auntie, some more of those income-tax forms.’ So the old lady says, ‘What are they exactly, dear, let me see?’ So Miss Whittaker says, “Oh, only the usual things.’ And Miss Dawson says, ‘Dear, dear, what a lot of them. How complicated they do make these things to be sure.’ And we could see that Miss Whittaker was giving her several papers, all laid on top of one another, with just the places for the signatures left showing. So Miss Dawson signs the top one, and then lifts up the paper and looks underneath at the next one, and Miss Whittaker says, ‘They’re all the same,’ as if she was in a hurry to get them signed and done with. But Miss Dawson takes them out of her hand and starts looking through them, and suddenly she lets out a screech, and says, ‘I won’t have it, I won’t have it! I’m not dying yet. How dare you, you wicked girl! Can’t you wait till I’m dead?⁠—You want to frighten me into my grave before my time. Haven’t you got everything you want?’ And Miss Whittaker says, ‘Hush, auntie, you won’t let me explain-’ and the old lady says, ‘No, I won’t, I don’t want to hear anything about it. I hate the thought of it. I won’t talk about it. You leave me be. I can’t get better if you keep frightening me so.’ And then she begins to take and carry on dreadful, and Miss Whittaker comes over to us looking awful white and says, ‘Run along, you girls,’ she says, ‘my aunt’s taken ill and can’t attend to business. I’ll call you if I want you,’ she says. And I said, ‘Can we help with her, miss?’ and she says, ‘No, it’s quite all right. It’s just the pain come on again. I’ll give her her injection and then she’ll be all right.’ And she pushes us out of the room, and shuts the door, and we heard the poor old lady crying fit to break anybody’s heart. So we went downstairs and met Nurse just coming in, and we told her Miss Dawson was took worse again, and she runs up quick without taking her things off. So we was in the kitchen, just saying it seemed rather funny-like, when Miss Whittaker comes down again and says, ‘It’s all right now, and Auntie’s sleeping quite peaceful, only we’ll have to put off business till another day.’ And she says, ‘Better not say anything about this to anybody, because when the pain comes on Aunt gets frightened and talks a bit wild. She don’t mean what she says, but if people was to hear about it they might think it odd.’ So I up and says, ‘Miss Whittaker,’ I says, ‘me and Bertha was never ones to talk’; rather stiff, I said it, because I don’t hold by gossip and never did. And Miss Whittaker says, ‘That’s quite all right,’ and goes away. And the next day she gives us an afternoon off and a present⁠—ten shillings each, it was, because it was her aunt’s birthday, and the old lady wanted us to have a little treat in her honour.”</p>
			<p>“A very clear account indeed, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, and I only wish all witnesses were as sensible and observant as you are. There’s just one thing. Did you by any chance get a sight of this paper that upset Miss Dawson so much?”</p>
			<p>“No, sir⁠—only from a distance, that is, and in the looking-glass. But I think it was quite short-just a few lines of typewriting.”</p>
			<p>“I see. Was there a typewriter in the house, by the way?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, sir. Miss Whittaker used one quite often for business letters and so on. It used to stand in the sitting-room.”</p>
			<p>“Quite so. By the way, do you remember Miss Dawson’s solicitor calling shortly after this?”</p>
			<p>“No, sir. It was only a little time later Bertha broke the teapot and we left. Miss Whittaker gave her her month’s warning, but I said no. If she could come down on a girl like that for a little thing, and her such a good worker, Bertha should go at once and me with her. Miss Whittaker said, ‘Just as you like,’ she said⁠—she never was one to stand any backchat. So we went that afternoon. But afterwards I think she was sorry, and came over to see us at Christchurch, and suggested why shouldn’t we try for a better job in London. Bertha was a bit afraid to go so far⁠—taking after Father, as I mentioned, but Mother, as was always the ambitious one, she says, ‘If the lady’s kind enough to give you a good start, why not go? There’s more chances for a girl in Town.’ And I said to Bertha, private-like, afterwards, I says, ‘Depend on it, Miss Whittaker wants to see the back of us. She’s afraid we’ll get talking about the things Miss Dawson said that morning. But, I says, if she’s willing to pay us to go, why not go, I says. A girl’s got to look out for herself these days, and if we go off to London she’ll give us a better character than what she would if we stayed. And anyway, I said, if we don’t like it we can always come home again.’ So the long and short was, we came to Town, and after a bit we got good jobs with Lyons, what with the good character Miss Whittaker gave us, and I met my husband there and Bertha met her Jim. So we never regretted having taken the chance⁠—not till this dreadful thing happened to Bertha.”</p>
			<p>The passionate interest with which her hearers had received this recital must have gratified <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper’s sense of the dramatic. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles was very slowly rotating his hands over one another with a dry, rustling sound⁠—like an old snake, gliding through the long grass in search of prey.</p>
			<p>“A little scene after your own heart, Murbles,” said Lord Peter, with a glint under his dropped eyelids. He turned again to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper.</p>
			<p>“This is the first time you’ve told this story?”</p>
			<p>“Yes⁠—and I wouldn’t have said anything if it hadn’t been⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I know. Now, if you’ll take my advice, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper, you won’t tell it again. Stories like that have a nasty way of bein’ dangerous. Will you consider it an impertinence if I ask you what your plans are for the next week or two?”</p>
			<p>“I’m going to see Mother and get her to come back to Canada with me. I wanted her to come when I got married, but she didn’t like going so far away from Bertha. She was always Mother’s favourite⁠—taking so much after Father, you see. Mother and me was always too much alike to get on. But now she’s got nobody else, and it isn’t right for her to be all alone, so I think she’ll come with me. It’s a long journey for an ailing old woman, but I reckon blood’s thicker than water. My husband said, ‘Bring her back first-class, my girl, and I’ll find the money.’ He’s a good sort, is my husband.”</p>
			<p>“You couldn’t do better,” said Wimsey, “and if you’ll allow me, I’ll send a friend to look after you both on the train journey and see you safe on to the boat. And don’t stop long in England. Excuse me buttin’ in on your affairs like this, but honestly I think you’d be safer elsewhere.”</p>
			<p>“You don’t think that Bertha—?”</p>
			<p>Her eyes widened with alarm.</p>
			<p>“I don’t like to say quite what I think, because I don’t know. But I’ll see you and your mother are safe, whatever happens.”</p>
			<p>“And Bertha? Can I do anything about that?”</p>
			<p>“Well, you’ll have to come and see my friends at Scotland Yard, I think, and tell them what you’ve told me. They’ll be interested.”</p>
			<p>“And will something be done about it?”</p>
			<p>“I’m sure, if we can prove there’s been any foul play, the police won’t rest till it’s been tracked down to the right person. But the difficulty is, you see, to prove that the death wasn’t natural.”</p>
			<p>“I observe in today’s paper,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, “that the local superintendent is now satisfied that Miss Gotobed came down alone for a quiet picnic and died of a heart attack.”</p>
			<p>“That man would say anything,” said Wimsey. “We know from the postmortem that she had recently had a heavy meal⁠—forgive these distressin’ details, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Cropper⁠—so why the picnic?”</p>
			<p>“I suppose they had the sandwiches and the beer-bottle in mind,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Murbles, mildly.</p>
			<p>“I see. I suppose she went down to Epping alone with a bottle of Bass and took out the cork with her fingers. Ever tried doing it, Murbles? No? Well, when they find the corkscrew I’ll believe she went there alone. In the meantime, I hope the papers will publish a few more theories like that. Nothin’ like inspiring criminals with confidence, Murbles⁠—it goes to their heads, you know.”</p>
